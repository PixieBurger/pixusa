**I love the colors of the fall. Almost like the Sakura (cherry blossom) season the red leave time is a magic time of the year. 
I still remember those crazy red forests near Seoul. I knew that the maple trees in Canada are spectacular this time of the year. 
Well, as we are amost in Canada it was a natural suggestion to go out and explore the famous fall colors in Washington. We have found a 
road trip which drives as to the heart of the fall leaves colors.   
For what was advertised to be a fall color viewing trip turned out to be slightly different.**





On day one we drove to the so called Artist Point near MT Baker. The red carpet painted by the blueberries were indeed the thing I was hunting for. We did a short hike as it was unexpectedly cold.

Thanks God this was the closest encounter to bears in Washington.

Things started to get wild when we arrived to the highest point of our trip this weekend. Trees were snowy and weather was very grey. On our hike we ended up in a snowstorm. This was especially unfortunate as the heavy snow and the heavy wind cancelled quicly the traces of the few other hiker being out there that day.

Next morning before hitting the roads we peaked in the award winning coffee place near our night shelter.

We closed the trip with a Queen musical in Everett.

It was a great adventure -> I wish many more like this!
