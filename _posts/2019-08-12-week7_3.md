**in California**

In the weekend Moritz joined me in exploring California. We have tried to continue our tradition of spending the weekends hiking. However shortly we realized that it is far too hot and the forests within doable car ride are not as impressive as in Washington. The size of the trees were impressive though. Seeing the signs of past forest fires was both sad and interesting.

On the way back we visited a winery, which fortunately enough was already closed. Fortunately as otherwise we would have needed to spend 18 usd (+ tip!) on a glass of wine.

The last remaining free day we have used to do a classic beach drive. First stop was the Half Moon day where the mistery fog slowly cleaned up while we had our snack lunch. The access to the beach was a bit difficult to some of us, but saving on the 10 usd parking ticket was worth it.

This was the first time I have seen pelicans.

Well, I am sure I would not like to share the road with cars here!

We (=Moritz) drove down to Santa Cruz where we have seen some sea lions resting on the pier.

We arrived back home just right in time to enjoy the tasty dinner prepared by Fenia.
