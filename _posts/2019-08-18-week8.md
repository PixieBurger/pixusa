Monday evening we took night flight back to Seattle.

And yes FINALLY my beautiful new bike arrived!

On our first daytrip we have explored the Bainbridge island. 
The view over the city during the 30 minute long ferry ride was impressive and worth the 9 USD cost paid for me and my bike.

On the island I was not too happy sharing the road with the cars. 
I was a bit tired and the elevation difference on the roads did not help making me feel better either.
Apparently there are quite some people commuting to Seattle from this island.

**New month new rental!**

Moritz each month rents another car. This month he was in big agony in deciding which car to rent. He made decision to economize and rent the smallest (cheapest option). 
However he ended up picking this small Toyota as the one he booked was not available at the rental place. Great upgrade for free! We both love driving this little car at least as much as posing next to it.

**I start to think that in Washington the weather is always like this grey and foggy.**
So we hit the roads for our first wild campig experience. We have targeted the Gotic Basin. Due to weather conditions the mood was not great on Saturday. Even so as I needed to carry the heavy packpack and walk uphill for 4 hours. Thanks God we have reached the camp place before darkness came.

Mortz made this little construction as precautionary measure to hide our food from our friends the bears.

The morning found us with greyness, I did not feel like coming out of my tent before 9 in the morning.

There is no official camp site in the Gothic Basin. However authorities are working towards establishing one. As a start they have built a scenic toilet.

This was the last where Moritz saw me.
