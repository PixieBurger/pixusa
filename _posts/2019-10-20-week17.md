**While approaching the sunny (!) Seattle on Friday from my little plane window I had a 
great view of all the four volcanoes south of Seattle. It was a very easy decision then what to do during the weekend. We went on volcano tour!**

"Paradise is the thing not to miss once you are in Washington."- was the statement by the Morca and he was right!

Accomodation was not an easy go, I have found a cute-looking cabin in Oregon, an hour drive from the St Hellens visitor center. As being said, 
the place looked cute, but smelled horrible. On Airbnb it was not really clear that this is going to be an RV disguised to be a cabin. Well, we had our RV experience. 

St Hellens - unfortunately it was very bad weather on the weekend we had a permit to climb this volcanoe. It was still a great idea to visit. 
It was in 1980 when St Helens erupted the last time burning all the forest and killing all living being in the neigborhood. Even after 40 years the landscape looks like you are walking on the moon. 
We did a somall tour around the devastated area.
