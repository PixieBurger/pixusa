**As Monday came Moritz had to head back to work. This however did not mean that I would follow. 
I took my sweet time to further enjoy the sunshine in California.**

Monday morning I took the train to San Diego. 

It really felt like being in Mexico. Oh well, Seattle feels 
like being in Canada and the south feels like Mexico so I am really wondering where the REAL AMERICA is.

I have found a (cheap) airbnb where I could borrow the old bike of the owner for free. 
So I have spent my days crusing from beach to beach. Just watching the surfers just enjoying the waves.

Apparently cycling paths in San Diego are pretty pleasant ones, plus I took my bike on the bus for free. Especially this combination was great.
