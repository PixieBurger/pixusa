**Seattle has many names like the Emerald City, the Green City every every synonim of the Rainy City. On our second weekend of 
September the autumn greeted us with a huge thunderstorm on Saturday night. Thanks God we were not out camping in the wild!**

According to normal the weather in September shall still be okay for outdoors. This storm came as a surprise not only to us but to the whole state.

We did a daytrip to visit Deception pass. This is a perfect place for an introductory hike once our families would visit.

Sunday the weather was not any better. We decided to do a mini hike just to train ourselves for the rainy season to come.
