This week we had the honour to stay in the Gousios castle (the Airbnb in Menlo Park). While Moritz was working I explored the neigborhood with the bike of Georgios.

Next year I am going to write a thesys in order to complete my actuarial studies. I thought visiting Standford University will be a classy kick off of this project. 
The campus was of about 15 minute bike ride away from our house of the week. It was a very relaxed experience cycling through the campus, especially fruitful encounter with the fancy coffee bars of the Standford Shopping village.

Later in the afternoon while waiting for dinner prepared by Mark I visited the park near the office.

This was the spot where I got flat tire. Thanks to the skills Moritz has acquired in his past professional life and facilities provided by the company my problem was quickly solved.

**The city of the dreams**
The next days I have ventured further. There was a very good train connection taking me to San Francisco. 
Not only the city but also the train ride especially the conditions you could take your bike on was like a dream. You need to pay no extra fee for taking your bike on board. 
Unlike my NS experience in Holland here there was no shortage of space to place my bike.

Before you would be disappointed by looking at the title picture of my blog - do not worry the red bridge was not repainted to grey. 
Later on I have also found the red version ;). Seeing all those turisty pictures people post about this bridge I have found it overrated. 
Now I know that you actually need to be there, you need to see and only then you understand how incredibly wonderful this thing is.
Of course me being not any different than others I could not stop taking pictures of the bridge.

It is easy to get lost in San Francisco. It is even easier to fall in love with the city. Wide streets and cutely jammed houses sorrounded by rocky beaches.
