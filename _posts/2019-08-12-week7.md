I am trying hard to learn american. Sometimes it is easy sometimes it gives me a hard time. It took me a while until 
I do not alliterate something chinese when I see “Xing” printed on the asphalt. Likewise the tables stating “Ped xing” = Pedestrian Crossing...

**Saturday evening the Gousios family (known from [gousios.gr](http://gousios.gr)) landed in Seattle.** 
For Moritz and me this meant a competition with time to drive from Sequim back to Seattle in time so that we arrive earlier to our apartment than they do. 
We lost, but fortunately backup plan was well arranged - they had the keys to our home. 

The Gousios family consist of the following four units Georgios, Fenia, Eli and the little one Aris. 
Giorgios is Moritz’s academic godfather, he is currently is about to complete his sabbatical/assignement 
in Menlo Park. By pure coincidence Georgios and Moritz work for the same company. Urgent business needs required the 
two guys to swap office desks for a week.

Out of the Gousios units, Elli, the five-year old polyglot, not only impressed us with her fluent English (never mind the occasional 'putted') but also her newly acquired ability to solve fairly involved equations. Meanwhile "her brother" Aris was displaying Herculean strength and Stoicism in trying to pry open an automatic door in the office -- I think he tried at least 10x and nearly made it every time, but not quite. A great character in the making.

**This gave the opportunity to all of us to explore the life in the xchange cities.**

We made sure that they taste the pizza made by Mod in Seattle and enjoy the sunshine in the beacshes of the Discovery park.

Various measures has been taken to prevent the little feet of Aris to escape.

Not only life but the goodies and dinner at the office too. First Monday evening we enjoyed rooftopping in the Seattle office.

The second Monday evening we enjoyed a quick dinner together in the Menlo Park office just before we rode back to the airport. 
Following this article I made sure to double check and confirm that all is true what this article is writing about the campus experience. The place is just overwhelming:

 Including the ice cream shop, ughg...
