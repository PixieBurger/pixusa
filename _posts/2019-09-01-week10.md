From the very beggining of my stay in Seattle I am hunting for nice green places inside and outside of the City. During the first week of our stay my first exploration of the greens started with the Kinnear Park as our Airbnb was close by. With enthusiasm I took the first step inside the green area I was happy to see some trees and hear less of the trucks passing by. I was watching people doing thai chi. As going deeper into the park I have started seeing some abandoned bycicles... and some abandoned tents... and then <<oooo ***!!>> I have realized that as I was walking I was sorrounded by homeless people camping in this park! These people are just tenting in the middle of the city! Coming from the Netherlands - where apparently you hardly see any homeless people ever - this was a great shock to me. I was really scared and felt uncomfortable. I fastened my steps and quickly came out of the park. Unfortunately this was not the last I felt this way.
